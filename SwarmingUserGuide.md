This pages describe the CLI python client that uses the Swarming server REST API. The server REST API can also be used directly if desired but it is not documented here (TODO), please read the sources in the meantime.

`swarming.py` is the client side script to manage Swarming tasks at the command line.

**Warning:** This doc is bound to become out of date. Here's one weird trick:
  * "`swarming.py help`" gives you all the help you need so only a quick overview is given here:


# Running a task synchronously #

If you just want to run something remotely, you can use the `run` command. It is going to block until the command has completely run remotely.

```
swarming.py run --swarming <host> --isolate-server <isolate_host> <isolated|hash>
```

The `<hash>` is what `isolate.py archive` gave you. See IsolatedUserGuide for more information. A path to a `.isolated` file will work too.


# Describing a task #

Swarming tasks are normally running a isolated tree directly via run\_isolated. A task is described by two sets of parameters;

  * The request metadata, e.g. who triggered it, when, tags, etc.
  * The request data, e.g. what command, what dimensions, environment variables if any, etc.

The dimensions are important. For example be clear upfront if you assume an Intel processor, the OS distribution version, e.g. Windows-7-SP1 vs Windows-Vista-SP2.


## Task idempotency ##

It's important to be very careful with the request data, as if the data is deterministic (including the files themselves) it is possible to use the `--idempotent` flag. This flag tells the server to **skip** the task if the exact same command was run previously and succeeded. This basically means that if you run the test twice and it succeeded, the second request is served the results from the first request. This saves a lot of time and infrastructure usage.

For a task to be idempotent, it must depend on nothing else than the task description:
  * isolated files mapped in
  * dimensions are uniquely describe the type of bot required (exact OS version, any other important detail)

If a task fetches anything from a remote service, it must not be marked as idempotent since it is not reproducible by definition.


# Running a task asynchronously #

The buildbot slaves uses `trigger` + `collect`, so they can do multiple things simultaneously. The general idea is that you trigger all the tests you want to run immediately, then collect the results.


## Triggering ##

Triggers a task and exits without waiting for it:
```
swarming.py trigger --swarming <host> --isolate-server <isolate_host> --task <name> <hash>
```

  * `<name>` is the name you want to give to the task, like "`base_unittests`".
  * `<hash>` is an `.isolated` hash.

Run `help trigger` for more information.


## Collecting results ##

Collects results for a previously triggered task. The results can be collected multiple times without problem until they are expired on the server. This means you can collect again data run from a job triggered via `run`.

```
swarming.py collect --swarming <host> <name>
```


# Querying bot states #

`swarming.py query` returns state about the known bots. More APIs will be added, like returning tasks, once needed by someone. In the meantime the web frontend shows these.


# More info #

The client tools are all self-documenting. Use "`swarming.py help`" for more information.
