## Complete test distribution toolkit for _low overhead high parallelism_ test execution ##

# Goal #

> Get test results within 10 minutes, independent of the number of tests to run or their duration. _Run tests in **O(1)**_.

# A complete toolkit #

  * Strict separation between **task distribution** and **file distribution**.
    * Swarming distributes tasks across an army (thousands) of Swarming bots; SwarmingDesign and SwarmingUserGuide.
    * Isolate server distributes 10s of thousands of files _per task_. IsolatedDesign and IsolatedUserGuide.
  * Federated authentication and ACL support.
  * The `.isolated` file is generated via the Test Isolation `.isolate` language; IsolateDesign and IsolateUserGuide to reproduce a tree efficiently on any OS.
  * The `.isolate` file is generated by tracing the test executable with the tracing tools; TracingToolsDesign and TracingToolsUserGuide.


# Details #

  * Windows, OSX and Linux (Ubuntu).
  * Written in python 2.7.
  * Used by the Chromium infrastructure.
  * Knows how to shard [Google Test](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) executable efficiently.
  * Apache v2.0.


# User guides #

  * First of all, visit GettingTheSources which will then guide you to fetch the sources and create a complete setup.
    * Or jump to the subpages: GettingStartedBots then GettingStartedServerAppEngine.
  * TracingToolsUserGuide to trace your unit tests.
  * IsolateUserGuide to isolate your traced unit tests.
  * IsolatedUserGuide to archive the binaries in the cache.
  * SwarmingUserGuide to distribute your isolated tests and get results _fast_.
